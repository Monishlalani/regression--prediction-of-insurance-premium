## Predicting Insurance Premiums with Regression Analysis

• Built model to predict insurance policy amounts using Python.

• Performed data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, and model building.

• Used Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor algorithms.

• Found that clients with a BMI above 25 may be charged more.

• Suggested focusing on clients with the best BMI for potentially profitable clients due to their good health status.
